I worked on creating a new skillset for Amazon Echo and connecting the Particle through exploring AWS lambda and Alexa developer console. I was able to familiarize myself with AWS and Alexa developr console through troubleshooting and researching many problems I encountered.

# Starter project 


My starter project is the Simon says game, in which the game will light up the 4 buttons in a certain order and the user must press the buttons in that order. The project includes parts such as LED lights, battery clips, a resistor, and switches, some being soldered on and screwed on. To play the game, turn the power switch on and press a random button. Then the buttons will light up in different orders one by one. There is also a sound switch that enables a different sound for each button when it is turned on.
